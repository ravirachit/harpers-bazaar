              "fulltext": "&lt;p&gt;In 1989 actor Dimple Kapadia, star of the film Bobby (1973), was photographed in a campaign wearing a velvet, high-collared men&amp;rsquo;s sherwani. The image was for designers Abu Jani and Sandeep Khosla, who had opened their first store, &lt;em&gt;Mata Hari&lt;/em&gt;, just three years before in 1986 in Juhu, Mumbai. The gender-bending sherwani might be hailed as cutting- edge in the current conversations about gender-fluid dressing when images of women in power suits and men in skirts still get feted. But for the Mumbai-based duo, designing is never according to gender; or even age, sexual orientation, or any of the other categories we&amp;rsquo;ve constructed for ourselves. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s about beauty,&amp;rdquo; says Jani, &amp;ldquo;that&amp;rsquo;s what we&amp;rsquo;re always looking for. There has to be emotion and poetry behind what you do.&amp;rdquo; This tireless pursuit of beauty has led the longtime partners and colleagues to become masters of craft. Their work is defined by detailed threadwork embroideries&amp;mdash;from subtle white on white &lt;em&gt;chikankari&lt;/em&gt;, to intricate aari, shimmering real gold or silver zardozi, metallic &lt;em&gt;mukaish &lt;/em&gt;patterns, and graphic use of mirrorwork. On lavish bridal lehengas, saris, and voluminous&lt;em&gt; anarkalis&lt;/em&gt;, their colourful patterns demonstrate the skill and painstaking hours of work that go into each hand-stitched piece.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Just one skirt, for example, embroidered in Tharad&amp;mdash; a region in Gujarat known for its unique threadwork&amp;mdash; can take upto six months to finish. They push their&lt;em&gt; karigars &lt;/em&gt;to excel, champion the purity of age-old techniques, and help maintain the craft&amp;rsquo;s status as covetable luxury. But it&amp;rsquo;s the uncertain future of these very crafts that is making the designers pause for thought. &amp;ldquo;We stand to lose everything to machines if coming generations don&amp;rsquo;t continue to treasure the beauty and refinement of the hand-crafted. Throughout history, Indians have been patrons of luxury and deeply appreciative of the textiles, weaves, and embroideries of India. Now our youth must carry forth this patronage,&amp;rdquo; says Khosla. &amp;ldquo;Crafts die out when they are no longer financially viable to practice. We need to make these skills not merely viable but profitable, by creating contemporary expressions of them that will find a market in India and across the globe. At the heart of all of this is the artisan, the embroiderer, or weaver who must&amp;nbsp;be valued and remunerated, empowered and trained to see crafts as a lucrative and respected profession.The next generation isn&amp;rsquo;t interested in doing what their parents did. You cannot treat artisans like cheap labour. Unless we really nurture the craft and respect the craftspeople of this country, we will lose it all.&amp;rdquo; Thirty-three years since they founded their label, the pair is rethinking how to grow. &amp;ldquo;When we started out it was just two of us scrambling to survive, impatient, overflowing with ideas of what we wanted to create. Now we have to become masters of marketing and share what we&amp;rsquo;ve done with the world,&amp;rdquo; adds Khosla.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In the last few years they have launched multiple sub-brands and collaborations. From the western line Khosla Jani, launched in 2014, to their diffusion label ASAL, 2016, or the most recent expansion Gulabo, 2018, which features breezy cotton with light touches of the brand&amp;rsquo;s signature embroideries. &amp;ldquo;The need of the hour is to get our work out there and make it more accessible,&amp;rdquo; says Jani. &amp;ldquo;It&amp;rsquo;s also exciting to think of new, innovative ways to work with the same techniques that we have used for over 30 years.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The two met for the first time in August 1986, in Mumbai through the designer Xerxes Bhathena. It took just one shared taxi ride home to cement their partnership. Together, they have created everything from furniture to wedding d&amp;eacute;cor (the first wedding they designed was that of Shweta Bachchan and Nikhil Nanda in 1997), and jewellery to footwear. They have accumulated fans in many of Bollywood&amp;rsquo;s first families&amp;mdash;from the Bachchans to the Kapoors; dressed Oscar winners like Judi Dench and their work has even been featured in the James Bond film,&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The World Is Not Enough (1999). &amp;ldquo;In his previous life, Abu was definitely a maharaja,&amp;rdquo; says Khosla. &amp;ldquo;That&amp;rsquo;s where our love for drama and luxury comes from. I was not a maharaja, but I was somewhere in that court, having fun, doing some creative nonsense.&amp;rdquo; That love for drama continues on the runway. Take last October&amp;rsquo;s big anniversary show which took place in Mumbai. The models stared down the cameras through space-age visors, twirling in their skirts, and dancing to the music. Even the men vogued and flexed in pieces from the new menswear line, Mard. The casting lineup included their favourite models Anna Bredmeyer, now 60, and Noyonika Chatterjee, in her 50s, along with other runway regulars. Previous shows have included dancers, musicians, and, once in 1995, even models Arjun Rampal and Milind Soman dancing in matching gold-spangled outfits. &amp;ldquo;The shows have to almost be a theatrical experience. The clothes demand that,&amp;rdquo; says Khosla. At a time when pessimism can take over, Khosla and Jani&amp;rsquo;s over-the-top, fabulously joyful presentations are a reminder that fashion can be a place for self-expression, indulgence and beauty for everyone.&lt;/p&gt;",

We&amp;rsquo;re talking about the &amp;lsquo;airport look&amp;rsquo;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nthe phenomenon in the backseat of her car, where, dressed in track pants and a loose T-shirt, she seems utterly confounded by the concept.&amp;ldquo;Honestly, I don&amp;rsquo;t care how I&amp;rsquo;m looking. If you want to take my photograph, take it, but I&amp;rsquo;m not in Chanel or Balmain or Balenciaga, I&amp;rsquo;m sorry. And the airport is not a runway. I just need to be comfortable. And it looks really silly, no, overdressed and all.&amp;rdquo; There&amp;rsquo;s no strategy, no artifice, no clothing racks brought by her stylist each time she boards a flight&amp;mdash;she is simply a working mother with a life to live.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=''  src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/img98081220113000.jpeg' width='389' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shirt and skirt, Tod&amp;rsquo;s. Earrings, Malabar Gold &amp;amp; Diamonds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Whether her pregnancy wardrobe or gym attire&amp;mdash;meticulously, frenetically, documented by blogs, magazines, and even news publications across the country&amp;mdash;what she wears is who she is. Yet, her authenticity, irreverence, and complete indifference to fashion statements catapulted her to social media stardom, without running a single public account herself. (Until March 5, when @kareenakapoorkhan made a surprise but stealthy Instagram debut.) &amp;ldquo;I don&amp;rsquo;t own a single piece of couture; it doesn&amp;rsquo;t interest me. I dress for my body type, and as long as I feel hot and look amazing, I&amp;rsquo;m happy. Like, you won&amp;rsquo;t see me in cycling shorts and a blazer just because it&amp;rsquo;s a trend. I think I look hot in the morning in my pyjamas with no makeup. Most people don&amp;rsquo;t understand that fashion needs to be relatable. I think for me, this relatability is also what&amp;rsquo;s led to my longevity in films.&amp;rdquo; Ah yes, this year Kareena celebrates two decades in cinema.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=''  src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/img57081220112504.jpeg' width='288' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shirt, Tod&amp;rsquo;s. Earrings, Malabar Gold &amp;amp; Diamonds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Her first role, that of a Muslim woman forced to relocate from Bangladesh to Pakistan, in the period drama Refugee, set the tone for her career. Here was an actor willing to take a risk, certain that it would pay off. Nonchalant if it didn&amp;rsquo;t. In an early interview from 2000, ahead of the release of Refugee, she said,&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;ldquo;I am glad they are giving me star status because I know I will be able to live up to it. I am very sure of my performance. Even if the film is a failure and doesn&amp;rsquo;t do well, I am ready for it.&amp;rdquo; Today, the resolute confidence of an 18-year-old hasn&amp;rsquo;t left her&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s only intensified, albeit matured. &amp;ldquo;I look back but I constantly move forward. That&amp;rsquo;s the person I am. Yes, maybe I&amp;rsquo;ve done some wrong films, but they are all my films.&lt;br /&gt;\r\nI think my failures have made me who I am. If you&amp;rsquo;re not ready for failure, this is not the place to be. And I&amp;rsquo;m at a stage where I&amp;rsquo;m ready for anything,&amp;rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=''  src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/img59081220112731.jpeg' width='318' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dress, Tod&amp;rsquo;s. All jewellery, Malabar Gold &amp;amp; Diamonds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In film, as in fashion, there&amp;rsquo;s a consistency to Kareena&amp;rsquo;s approach, and it&amp;rsquo;s rooted in an innate sense of self. An inner strength, she says. She remains unafraid of sharing screen space with an illustrious ensemble cast&amp;mdash;from Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001), to Udta Punjab (2016), Veere Di Wedding (2018), Good Newwz (2020), and the upcoming Takht (2020); she praises actors like Kangana Ranaut, Vidya Balan, and Alia Bhatt, whom she calls &amp;ldquo;spectacular&amp;rdquo; and &amp;ldquo;blessed&amp;rdquo;, without any qualms; and she maintains no insecurities of her place in an industry that has changed remarkably since her debut. &amp;ldquo;She has a star aura, she has a star persona. You can&amp;rsquo;t take that away from her. You want to watch her,&amp;rdquo; said Karan Johar, on Rendezvous with Simi Garewal, back in 2002. That sentiment holds true even now, as we shoot this cover at Mumbai&amp;rsquo;s Mehboob Studio&amp;mdash;where, of course, she was snapped by paparazzi eager to capture her every move.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=''  src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/img129081220113215.jpeg' width='275' /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dress, Tod&amp;rsquo;s. All jewellery, Malabar Gold &amp;amp; Diamonds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;ldquo;She is the perfect subject,&amp;rdquo; says Tarun Vishwa, who photographed this feature. &amp;ldquo;She has incredible, interactive eyes. And a complete awareness of her face, the light. You just can&amp;rsquo;t go wrong with her.&amp;rdquo; In front of the camera, she is magic. Kareena owns a particular and long-overdue distinction&amp;mdash; she is the first in her generation of actors to demonstrate the happy coexistence of motherhood and a successful career. Perhaps because her roles mirror her position in real life&amp;mdash; she&amp;rsquo;s no longer twentysomething Poo, but rather a 39-year- old woman who has something to say. Her comeback Veere Di Wedding&amp;mdash;though she was absent for just two years after the birth of her son&amp;mdash;not only joined the &amp;lsquo;100 crore club&amp;rsquo;, but did so by celebrating women who had agency, opinions, and flaws, with men at the periphery.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;img alt=''  src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/img127081220113337.jpeg' width='326' /&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shirt, Tod&amp;rsquo;s. All jewellery, Malabar Gold &amp;amp; Diamonds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;And in the subsequent Good Newwz&amp;mdash;Kareena&amp;rsquo;s second-highest grosser after 3 Idiots&amp;mdash;she portrayed a working woman with a ticking biological clock, yearning for a child. &amp;ldquo;Despite being married, despite being a mother, I&amp;rsquo;ve been able to crack being a part of the movie business. I think experience helps you make better decisions. I&amp;rsquo;m also a lot calmer now. Earlier I was more competitive, more hyper, doing five films at a time. I&amp;rsquo;ve started enjoying acting a lot more than I did earlier, and that&amp;rsquo;s why I think I&amp;rsquo;m a better actor now. I&amp;rsquo;m enjoying that process of getting into a role, and just doing one film at a time,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;The entire game of cinema has changed; the arc of cinema has changed. Women have to be a lot more fearless, and most of us are trying to do that. It&amp;rsquo;s a new age, it&amp;rsquo;s a new time.

              "amp_fulltext": "&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Seriously, what is going on?&rdquo; asks Kareena Kapoor Khan, incredulous. We&rsquo;re talking about the &lsquo;airport look&rsquo;&lt;br&gt;\nthe phenomenon in the backseat of her car, where, dressed in track pants and a loose T-shirt, she seems utterly confounded by the concept.&ldquo;Honestly, I don&rsquo;t care how I&rsquo;m looking. If you want to take my photograph, take it, but I&rsquo;m not in Chanel or Balmain or Balenciaga, I&rsquo;m sorry. And the airport is not a runway. I just need to be comfortable. And it looks really silly, no, overdressed and all.&rdquo; There&rsquo;s no strategy, no artifice, no clothing racks brought by her stylist each time she boards a flight&mdash;she is simply a working mother with a life to live.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;amp-img alt src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/img98081220113000.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;3043&quot; height=&quot;4110&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shirt and skirt, Tod&rsquo;s. Earrings, Malabar Gold &amp;amp; Diamonds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Whether her pregnancy wardrobe or gym attire&mdash;meticulously, frenetically, documented by blogs, magazines, and even news publications across the country&mdash;what she wears is who she is. Yet, her authenticity, irreverence, and complete indifference to fashion statements catapulted her to social media stardom, without running a single public account herself. (Until March 5, when @kareenakapoorkhan made a surprise but stealthy Instagram debut.) &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t own a single piece of couture; it doesn&rsquo;t interest me. I dress for my body type, and as long as I feel hot and look amazing, I&rsquo;m happy. Like, you won&rsquo;t see me in cycling shorts and a blazer just because it&rsquo;s a trend. I think I look hot in the morning in my pyjamas with no makeup. Most people don&rsquo;t understand that fashion needs to be relatable. I think for me, this relatability is also what&rsquo;s led to my longevity in films.&rdquo; Ah yes, this year Kareena celebrates two decades in cinema.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;amp-img alt src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/img57081220112504.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;2738&quot; height=&quot;3490&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shirt, Tod&rsquo;s. Earrings, Malabar Gold &amp;amp; Diamonds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Her first role, that of a Muslim woman forced to relocate from Bangladesh to Pakistan, in the period drama Refugee, set the tone for her career. Here was an actor willing to take a risk, certain that it would pay off. Nonchalant if it didn&rsquo;t. In an early interview from 2000, ahead of the release of Refugee, she said,&lt;br&gt;\n&ldquo;I am glad they are giving me star status because I know I will be able to live up to it. I am very sure of my performance. Even if the film is a failure and doesn&rsquo;t do well, I am ready for it.&rdquo; Today, the resolute confidence of an 18-year-old hasn&rsquo;t left her&mdash;it&rsquo;s only intensified, albeit matured. &ldquo;I look back but I constantly move forward. That&rsquo;s the person I am. Yes, maybe I&rsquo;ve done some wrong films, but they are all my films.&lt;br&gt;\nI think my failures have made me who I am. If you&rsquo;re not ready for failure, this is not the place to be. And I&rsquo;m at a stage where I&rsquo;m ready for anything,&rdquo; she says.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;amp-img alt src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/img59081220112731.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;3018&quot; height=&quot;4087&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dress, Tod&rsquo;s. All jewellery, Malabar Gold &amp;amp; Diamonds&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;In film, as in fashion, there&rsquo;s a consistency to Kareena&rsquo;s approach, and it&rsquo;s rooted in an innate sense of self. An inner strength, she says. She remains unafraid of sharing screen space with an illustrious ensemble cast&mdash;from Kabhi Khushi Kabhie Gham (2001), to Udta Punjab (2016), Veere Di Wedding (2018), Good Newwz (2020), and the upcoming Takht (2020); she praises actors like Kangana Ranaut, Vidya Balan, and Alia Bhatt, whom she calls &ldquo;spectacular&rdquo; and &ldquo;blessed&rdquo;, without any qualms; and she maintains no insecurities of her place in an industry that has changed remarkably since her debut. &ldquo;She has a star aura, she has a star persona. You can&rsquo;t take that away from her. You want to watch her,&rdquo; said Karan Johar, on Rendezvous with Simi Garewal, back in 2002. That sentiment holds true even now, as we shoot this cover at Mumbai&rsquo;s Mehboob Studio&mdash;where, of course, she was snapped by paparazzi eager to capture her every move.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;amp-img alt src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/img129081220113215.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;3018&quot; height=&quot;4092&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Dress, Tod&rsquo;s. All jewellery, Malabar Gold &amp;amp; Diamonds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&ldquo;She is the perfect subject,&rdquo; says Tarun Vishwa, who photographed this feature. &ldquo;She has incredible, interactive eyes. And a complete awareness of her face, the light. You just can&rsquo;t go wrong with her.&rdquo; In front of the camera, she is magic. Kareena owns a particular and long-overdue distinction&mdash; she is the first in her generation of actors to demonstrate the happy coexistence of motherhood and a successful career. Perhaps because her roles mirror her position in real life&mdash; she&rsquo;s no longer twentysomething Poo, but rather a 39-year- old woman who has something to say. Her comeback Veere Di Wedding&mdash;though she was absent for just two years after the birth of her son&mdash;not only joined the &lsquo;100 crore club&rsquo;, but did so by celebrating women who had agency, opinions, and flaws, with men at the periphery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;amp-img alt src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/img127081220113337.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;3071&quot; height=&quot;4061&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Shirt, Tod&rsquo;s. All jewellery, Malabar Gold &amp;amp; Diamonds.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;And in the subsequent Good Newwz&mdash;Kareena&rsquo;s second-highest grosser after 3 Idiots&mdash;she portrayed a working woman with a ticking biological clock, yearning for a child. &ldquo;Despite being married, despite being a mother, I&rsquo;ve been able to crack being a part of the movie business. I think experience helps you make better decisions. I&rsquo;m also a lot calmer now. Earlier I was more competitive, more hyper, doing five films at a time. I&rsquo;ve started enjoying acting a lot more than I did earlier, and that&rsquo;s why I think I&rsquo;m a better actor now. I&rsquo;m enjoying that process of getting into a role, and just doing one film at a time,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;The entire game of cinema has changed; the arc of cinema has changed. Women have to be a lot more fearless, and most of us are trying to do that. It&rsquo;s a new age, it&rsquo;s a new time. I love.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;&lt;amp-img alt src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/img164091220122607.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;2917&quot; height=&quot;3948&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Dress, Tod&rsquo;s.

              "fulltext": "&lt;p&gt;Just a few hours before this interview&amp;nbsp;takes place, &amp;nbsp;Sobhita Dhulipala&amp;nbsp;has found herself a new apartment. &amp;quot;Finally!&amp;quot; she exclaims, &amp;quot;I&amp;rsquo;ve been searching for months.&amp;quot; For the record, there is nothing unlivable about her current abode. It&amp;#39;s just that she feels she has &amp;quot;emotionally outgrown&amp;quot; the space. &amp;quot;I am looking forward to the newness that setting up a place will bring... I feel like I&amp;rsquo;m adulting, man!&amp;quot; she laughs. Sobhita would like, very much, for her new home to have a Parisian vibe-an aesthetic she is &amp;quot;smitten by&amp;quot;. &amp;nbsp;&amp;quot;I want it to be cosy, intimate... There will be lots of plants, lots of white, lots of books, and the house will smell of freshly-brewed coffee and have jazz music playing all the time,&amp;quot; she says. Did she already mention the plants, she asks. Yes, she did, I confirm. &amp;quot;I&amp;#39;m obsessed with plants, right now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nI&amp;#39;ve spent so much time researching them,&amp;quot; she says. The hunt for a new apartment-and its future trimmings-is one of the things that has kept the actor busy during the nationwide lockdown. The other, is the launch of a &amp;lsquo;creative studio&amp;rsquo;. Sort of. (Sobhita isn&amp;rsquo;t fussed about giving her new digital venture a rigid title; &amp;quot;You can call it whatever you like,&amp;quot; she says). Earlier this month, she published a heartfelt &amp;#39;open note&amp;#39; on Instagram, inviting submissions for scripts, stories, and ideas. It was an impulsive idea, Sobhita reveals, one she is incredibly excited about. &amp;ldquo;I would watch how some actors, with certain credibility or commercial standing, were able to facilitate wonderful projects, and I&amp;rsquo;d think, &amp;lsquo;Damn, I have to be a big star to do that.&amp;rsquo; But then I thought, &amp;lsquo;Why can&amp;rsquo;t I just democratise the way ideas are brought into the industry? I mean, it&amp;rsquo;s not like I am some extraordinary person...I&amp;rsquo;m small fry, but this could be a way to support creative expression. Because on one side, there&amp;rsquo;s so much talent in the country...&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=''  src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/5-013-copy011220020933.jpeg' width='409' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nI speak to so many people, and their life stories are insanely exciting. And on the other side, there are producers and platforms and mediums that are searching for something original, relatable, and fresh. So I feel like I want to be this &amp;lsquo;middle ground&amp;rsquo; where I can create a bank of stories and scripts, and people can come &amp;lsquo;shop them&amp;rsquo;. It&amp;rsquo;s quite exciting, really!&amp;rdquo; There has always been a voracious reader at the core of Sobhita. As a young girl&amp;mdash;shy and timid&amp;mdash;many of her learnings about life, people, sexuality, and emotions came from the pages she spent hours poring over. Books became her &amp;ldquo;Narnia&amp;rdquo;, her door into other dimensions. In the days of social distancing, Sobhita is reading (&amp;ldquo;bingeing on!&amp;rdquo;) poetry by Tishani Doshi&amp;mdash;a genre she takes delights in. &amp;nbsp;And, of course, there are the several, thousand scripts she has received from hopeful writers. &amp;nbsp;&amp;auml; &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ve been soaking up people&amp;rsquo;s life stories...taking in their emotions,&amp;rdquo; she says. &amp;ldquo;There is no race to run; everyone&amp;rsquo;s home, so I don&amp;rsquo;t have to feel like sh*t for being lazy and doing nothing. I asked a friend the other day about what made us &amp;lsquo;grow up&amp;rsquo; in school, when we transferred from one grade to the next? It was the same school, the same uniform and yet, every grade felt different. I realised that we &amp;lsquo;grew up&amp;rsquo; during our summer holidays. And while I haven&amp;rsquo;t had a vacation since school, this lockdown has been an opportunity for me to introspect, which is a great luxury. I&amp;rsquo;ve gotten closer to myself, a lot closer. I&amp;rsquo;ve admitted to a couple of my shortcomings, instead of blaming situations or other people. I like to call myself out when I&amp;rsquo;m wrong.&amp;rdquo; Sobhita&amp;rsquo;s &amp;ldquo;flaws&amp;rdquo; include being somewhat impatient and &amp;ldquo;living in her head&amp;rdquo;. She admits to how she can&amp;mdash;sometimes and unconsciously&amp;mdash;project her own expectations onto others. Which has often led to disappointment when they don&amp;rsquo;t live up to those assumptions. &amp;ldquo;It burdens the other person,&amp;rdquo; she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=''  src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/10-013011220021130.jpeg' width='331' /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n&amp;ldquo;In the past, I haven&amp;rsquo;t given relationships much time...I was quick to categorise people in my head, like, &amp;lsquo;This person is my &amp;lsquo;type&amp;rsquo; or this person isn&amp;rsquo;t&amp;rsquo;. And that has not always been the reality... So I&amp;rsquo;ve been working on that, not judging a book by its cover...&amp;rdquo; I have spoken with Sobhita a few times before, and if there is one thing that struck me then&amp;mdash;and that strikes me now&amp;mdash;it is this: there is absolutely nothing generic about the 28-year-old. It is clear to see that she holds ample sex appeal, often hard to conceal. And when she speaks, the words are often deliberate, but she doesn&amp;rsquo;t seem to be holding back. She could be in a Fritz Lang-film noir, a bohemian at the brink of a golden age, or a protagonist in a Satyajit Ray film. It&amp;rsquo;s entirely possible to imagine her a brooding poet or a philosopher discussing neo-Platonism, but she is also the cool-girl from university who discovered ripped jeans before her classmates followed. &amp;nbsp;She is all those things, and she is none of them. Her friend, photographer Farrokh Chothia, describes Sobhita as &amp;ldquo;a soul from another time&amp;rdquo;. The two met some years ago, he can&amp;rsquo;t remember precisely when, but they quickly became the kind of friends who have eight-hour-long chats, about music and art and the meaning of life. &amp;ldquo;She is like a diva from some bygone era...some mythical past,&amp;rdquo; Farrokh shares with me. &amp;ldquo;I always tell her she was born a few decades too late for Woodstock. There&amp;rsquo;s a depth to Sobhita which is fascinating, and if you&amp;rsquo;ve read her writing, you&amp;rsquo;ll know what I mean.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br /&gt;\r\nShe has absorbed so much literature and music from the past, that it&amp;rsquo;s all part of this wonderful mix, packaged into a contemporary form.

She tells me that she has always been drawn to vintage and timeless pieces.

              "amp_fulltext": "&lt;p&gt;Just a few hours before this interview&amp;nbsp;takes place, &amp;nbsp;Sobhita Dhulipala&amp;nbsp;has found herself a new apartment. &quot;Finally!&quot; she exclaims, &quot;I&rsquo;ve been searching for months.&quot; For the record, there is nothing unlivable about her current abode. It's just that she feels she has &quot;emotionally outgrown&quot; the space. &quot;I am looking forward to the newness that setting up a place will bring... I feel like I&rsquo;m adulting, man!&quot; she laughs. Sobhita would like, very much, for her new home to have a Parisian vibe-an aesthetic she is &quot;smitten by&quot;. &amp;nbsp;&quot;I want it to be cosy, intimate... There will be lots of plants, lots of white, lots of books, and the house will smell of freshly-brewed coffee and have jazz music playing all the time,&quot; she says. Did she already mention the plants, she asks. Yes, she did, I confirm. &quot;I'm obsessed with plants, right now.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\nI've spent so much time researching them,&quot; she says. The hunt for a new apartment-and its future trimmings-is one of the things that has kept the actor busy during the nationwide lockdown. The other, is the launch of a &lsquo;creative studio&rsquo;. Sort of. (Sobhita isn&rsquo;t fussed about giving her new digital venture a rigid title; &quot;You can call it whatever you like,&quot; she says). Earlier this month, she published a heartfelt 'open note' on Instagram, inviting submissions for scripts, stories, and ideas. It was an impulsive idea, Sobhita reveals, one she is incredibly excited about. &ldquo;I would watch how some actors, with certain credibility or commercial standing, were able to facilitate wonderful projects, and I&rsquo;d think, &lsquo;Damn, I have to be a big star to do that.&rsquo; But then I thought, &lsquo;Why can&rsquo;t I just democratise the way ideas are brought into the industry? I mean, it&rsquo;s not like I am some extraordinary person...I&rsquo;m small fry, but this could be a way to support creative expression. Because on one side, there&rsquo;s so much talent in the country...&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;amp-img alt src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/5-013-copy011220020933.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1445&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nI speak to so many people, and their life stories are insanely exciting. And on the other side, there are producers and platforms and mediums that are searching for something original, relatable, and fresh. So I feel like I want to be this &lsquo;middle ground&rsquo; where I can create a bank of stories and scripts, and people can come &lsquo;shop them&rsquo;. It&rsquo;s quite exciting, really!&rdquo; There has always been a voracious reader at the core of Sobhita. As a young girl&mdash;shy and timid&mdash;many of her learnings about life, people, sexuality, and emotions came from the pages she spent hours poring over. Books became her &ldquo;Narnia&rdquo;, her door into other dimensions. In the days of social distancing, Sobhita is reading (&ldquo;bingeing on!&rdquo;) poetry by Tishani Doshi&mdash;a genre she takes delights in. &amp;nbsp;And, of course, there are the several, thousand scripts she has received from hopeful writers. &amp;nbsp;&auml; &ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been soaking up people&rsquo;s life stories...taking in their emotions,&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;There is no race to run; everyone&rsquo;s home, so I don&rsquo;t have to feel like sh*t for being lazy and doing nothing. I asked a friend the other day about what made us &lsquo;grow up&rsquo; in school, when we transferred from one grade to the next? It was the same school, the same uniform and yet, every grade felt different. I realised that we &lsquo;grew up&rsquo; during our summer holidays. And while I haven&rsquo;t had a vacation since school, this lockdown has been an opportunity for me to introspect, which is a great luxury. I&rsquo;ve gotten closer to myself, a lot closer. I&rsquo;ve admitted to a couple of my shortcomings, instead of blaming situations or other people. I like to call myself out when I&rsquo;m wrong.&rdquo; Sobhita&rsquo;s &ldquo;flaws&rdquo; include being somewhat impatient and &ldquo;living in her head&rdquo;. She admits to how she can&mdash;sometimes and unconsciously&mdash;project her own expectations onto others. Which has often led to disappointment when they don&rsquo;t live up to those assumptions. &ldquo;It burdens the other person,&rdquo; she says.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;amp-img alt src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/10-013011220021130.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1080&quot; height=&quot;1445&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;br&gt;\n&ldquo;In the past, I haven&rsquo;t given relationships much time...I was quick to categorise people in my head, like, &lsquo;This person is my &lsquo;type&rsquo; or this person isn&rsquo;t&rsquo;. And that has not always been the reality... So I&rsquo;ve been working on that, not judging a book by its cover...&rdquo; I have spoken with Sobhita a few times before, and if there is one thing that struck me then&mdash;and that strikes me now&mdash;it is this: there is absolutely nothing generic about the 28-year-old. It is clear to see that she holds ample sex appeal, often hard to conceal. And when she speaks, the words are often deliberate, but she doesn&rsquo;t seem to be holding back. She could be in a Fritz Lang-film noir, a bohemian at the brink of a golden age, or a protagonist in a Satyajit Ray film. It&rsquo;s entirely possible to imagine her a brooding poet or a philosopher discussing neo-Platonism, but she is also the cool-girl from university who discovered ripped jeans before her classmates followed. &amp;nbsp;She is all those things, and she is none of them. Her friend, photographer Farrokh Chothia, describes Sobhita as &ldquo;a soul from another time&rdquo;. The two met some years ago, he can&rsquo;t remember precisely when, but they quickly became the kind of friends who have eight-hour-long chats, about music and art and the meaning of life. &ldquo;She is like a diva from some bygone era...some mythical past,&rdquo; Farrokh shares with me. &ldquo;I always tell her she was born a few decades too late for Woodstock. There&rsquo;s a depth to Sobhita which is fascinating, and if you&rsquo;ve read her writing, you&rsquo;ll know what I mean.&amp;nbsp;&lt;br&gt;\nShe has absorbed so much literature and music from the past, that it&rsquo;s all part of this wonderful mix, packaged into a contemporary form. And she oozes sensuality... she isn&rsquo;t even aware of the effect she has on people. Not just men,&amp;nbsp;but women, too&mdash;women seem to take to her and that, to me,&amp;nbsp; is a good indicator of a person&rsquo;s universal appeal.&rdquo; Farrokh&rsquo;s observations tie in with how Sobhita describes her own life, and interests. She tells me that she has always been drawn to vintage and timeless pieces. And if she could live in a different era, it would be the &rsquo;40s or &rsquo;50s. &ldquo;I&rsquo;m very enamoured by the glamour of those days, the simplicity...&rdquo; she says. &ldquo;It seems to me that people lived on their own terms because there was a lot less &lsquo;social intervention&rsquo;.&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;br&gt;\nThey were less afraid. I feel like somewhere, at some point, there has been a rise in &lsquo;suppression of expression&rsquo;. And people have felt this need to live up to some sort of an image.

What you&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;haven&amp;#39;t&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;seen are many of the following photos, some which were taken by the assistant of Lord Patrick Lichfield, a first cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth and the only informal photographer permitted to take photos at the wedding.

What you&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;haven't&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;seen are many of the following photos, some which were taken by the assistant of Lord Patrick Lichfield, a first cousin once removed of Queen Elizabeth and the only informal photographer permitted to take photos at the wedding. The images, never before seen by the public, show a more casual side of the royal family, from Diana embracing her youngest bridesmaid to Queen Elizabeth watching the wedding coverage on a small TV.

              "fulltext": "&lt;p&gt;Duchess Meghan has written a deeply personal and brave account of suffering a miscarriage.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;In a powerful article for&amp;nbsp;&lt;em&gt;&lt;a data-vars-ga-outbound-link='https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/opinion/meghan-markle-miscarriage.html' href='https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/25/opinion/meghan-markle-miscarriage.html' target='_blank'&gt;The New York Times&lt;/a&gt;&lt;/em&gt;&amp;nbsp;titled &amp;quot;The Losses We Share,&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-vars-ga-outbound-link='https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a34617377/meghan-markle-brandon-maxwell-remembrance-sunday-coat/' href='https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a34617377/meghan-markle-brandon-maxwell-remembrance-sunday-coat/' target='_blank'&gt;the Duchess of Sussex&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;revealed that she lost her unborn, second child in July.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Starting the piece with a description of a typical morning looking after son Archie Mountbatten-Windsor,&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-vars-ga-outbound-link='https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/g34507566/meghan-markle-best-zoom-fashion/' href='https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/g34507566/meghan-markle-best-zoom-fashion/' target='_blank'&gt;Meghan&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;wrote, &amp;quot;After changing his diaper, I felt a sharp cramp. I dropped to the floor with him in my arms, humming a lullaby to keep us both calm, the cheerful tune a stark contrast to my sense that something was not right. I knew, as I clutched my firstborn child, that I was losing my second.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The duchess, 39, was taken to the hospital, where she held onto&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-vars-ga-outbound-link='https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a34397698/meghan-markle-prince-harry-time-100-portrait/' href='https://www.harpersbazaar.com/celebrity/latest/a34397698/meghan-markle-prince-harry-time-100-portrait/' target='_blank'&gt;Prince Harry&lt;/a&gt;&amp;#39;s hand. &amp;quot;I felt the clamminess of his palm and kissed his knuckles, wet from both our tears,&amp;quot; she wrote. &amp;quot;Staring at the cold white walls, my eyes glazed over. I tried to imagine how we&amp;#39;d heal.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Describing it as &amp;quot;an almost unbearable grief, experienced by many but talked about by few,&amp;quot; Meghan wrote that despite the &amp;quot;staggering commonality of this pain,&amp;quot; talking about a miscarriage largely remains taboo, &amp;quot;riddled with (unwarranted) shame, and perpetuating a cycle of solitary mourning.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The duchess took the difficult steps to share her story in the hope that others will feel less afraid to do the same. She also hopes that by encouraging others to listen, the load will be lightened for those who are grieving.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Looking back at when she was hospitalized in July, Meghan recalled the moment last year in September when the Sussexes were finishing their royal tour of South Africa. &amp;quot;I was exhausted,&amp;quot; she wrote. &amp;quot;I was breastfeeding our infant son, and I was trying to keep a brave face in the very public eye.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;And then, British documentary maker Tom Bradby asked her if she was okay. &amp;quot;I answered him honestly, not knowing that what I said would resonate with so many&amp;mdash;new moms and older ones, and anyone who had, in their own way, been silently suffering,&amp;quot; she explained. &amp;quot;My off-the-cuff reply seemed to give people permission to speak their truth. But it wasn&amp;#39;t responding honestly that helped me most, it was the question itself. &amp;#39;Thank you for asking,&amp;#39; I said. &amp;#39;Not many people have asked if I&amp;#39;m OK.&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;She continued, &amp;quot;Sitting in a hospital bed, watching my husband&amp;#39;s heart break as he tried to hold the shattered pieces of mine, I realized that the only way to begin to heal is to first ask, &amp;#39;Are you OK?&amp;#39;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Are we? This year has brought so many of us to our breaking points. Loss and pain have plagued every one of us in 2020, in moments both fraught and debilitating.&amp;quot; She then went on to describe how a woman lost her mother to the coronavirus, how another man woke up feeling slightly ill and within weeks, he, too, had died.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Making references to Breonna Taylor and George Floyd, who both lost their lives to police brutality and sparked a resurgence of the Black Lives Matter movement this year, she continued, &amp;quot;Peaceful protests become violent. Health rapidly shifts to sickness. In places where there was once community, there is now division.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;She continued, &amp;quot;On top of all of this, it seems we no longer agree on what is true. We aren&amp;#39;t just fighting over our opinions of facts; we are polarized over whether the fact is, in fact, a fact. We are at odds over whether science is real. We are at odds over whether an election has been won or lost. We are at odds over the value of compromise. That polarization, coupled with the social isolation required to fight this pandemic, has left us feeling more alone than ever.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Toward the end of her editorial, the Duchess of Sussex described a moment in her late teens when she saw a woman on the phone in a &amp;quot;flood of tears&amp;quot; on a sidewalk in New York City. She asked her taxi driver to stop, but he told her, &amp;quot;Don&amp;#39;t worry, somebody on that corner will ask her if she&amp;#39;s OK.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;She wrote, &amp;quot;Now, all these years later, in isolation and lockdown, grieving the loss of a child, the loss of my country&amp;#39;s shared belief in what&amp;#39;s true, I think of that woman in New York. What if no one stopped? What if no one saw her suffering? What if no one helped?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;I wish I could go back and ask my cabdriver to pull over. This, I realize, is the danger of siloed living&amp;mdash;where moments sad, scary or sacrosanct are all lived out alone. There is no one stopping to ask, &amp;#39;Are you OK?&amp;#39;&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;She continued, &amp;quot;Losing a child means carrying an almost unbearable grief, experienced by many but talked about by few. In the pain of our loss, my husband and I discovered that in a room of 100 women, 10 to 20 of them will have suffered from miscarriage. Yet despite the staggering commonality of this pain, the conversation remains taboo, riddled with (unwarranted) shame, and perpetuating a cycle of solitary mourning.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;Some have bravely shared their stories; they have opened the door, knowing that when one person speaks truth, it gives license for all of us to do the same,&amp;quot; the Duchess of Sussex explained. &amp;quot;We have learned that when people ask how any of us are doing, and when they really listen to the answer, with an open heart and mind, the load of grief often becomes lighter&amp;mdash;for all of us. In being invited to share our pain, together we take the first steps toward healing.&amp;quot;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;If you or anyone you know has been affected by miscarriage, support and helpful information can be found at the&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-vars-ga-outbound-link='https://www.miscarriageassociation.org.uk/' href='https://www.miscarriageassociation.org.uk/' target='_blank'&gt;Miscarriage Association&lt;/a&gt;&amp;nbsp;and&amp;nbsp;&lt;a data-vars-ga-outbound-link='https://www.marchofdimes.org/' href='https://www.marchofdimes.org/' target='_blank'&gt;March of Dimes&lt;/a&gt;.&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",

              "fulltext": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:00 a.m.&lt;/strong&gt;&amp;nbsp; My dog, Diana, usually wakes me up. She&amp;rsquo;s so jet-lagged right now because she&amp;rsquo;s been travelling with me. I can hear her nails on the floor as she walks around the room&amp;mdash;I&amp;rsquo;m a very light sleeper. Nick [Jonas] isn&amp;rsquo;t like that at all. He doesn&amp;rsquo;t wake up. It&amp;rsquo;s really annoying! So I have to spend some time giving Diana attention, and then we both go back to sleep for a few more hours. I love to sleep.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:30 a.m.&lt;/strong&gt; The first thing I do in the morning is put on music. My life has always been pretty musical, and now with Nick,it&amp;rsquo;s completely musical. I decided to date him after seeing the video for &amp;lsquo;Close&amp;rsquo;, where his shirt comes off. So that song is my favourite. But I don&amp;rsquo;t like playing music on my phone; I have to have a JBL speaker to really hear it. I&amp;rsquo;ll blast the Top 40 radio while I&amp;rsquo;m getting ready.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:00 a.m.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m more spiritual than religious, so I have a little shrine with incense that I carry wherever I go. When I first movedto Mumbai at 17, I lived with my best friend. She always did a morning prayer. I was like, &amp;ldquo;Oh, my mom does this&amp;rdquo;, and you never want to emulate your parents, right? But she made me realise that this is a great way to start the day with some positivity. I say a few Hindu mantras, which are basically just saying &amp;lsquo;thank you&amp;rsquo; to the world. It&amp;rsquo;s a way to reflect and be grateful.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;8:30 a.m.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m not a big make-up person when I&amp;rsquo;m not working&amp;mdash;just mascara, tinted lip balm, and a little bit of a cheek situation. I like Marc Jacobs&amp;rsquo; mascara because it&amp;rsquo;s black as hell&amp;mdash;it really shows up. As for hair, ha! I can&amp;rsquo;t do hair. I either have it done by a professional or it&amp;rsquo;s in a topknot.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:00 a.m.&lt;/strong&gt; We have a Nespresso machine, so I make espresso. That&amp;rsquo;s what I call my &amp;ldquo;first breakfast&amp;rdquo;. Then, when I&amp;rsquo;m in New York, my assistant comes by with my &amp;ldquo;second breakfast&amp;rdquo;, a Sweetgreen bowl&amp;mdash;scrambled eggs, veggies, and farro. And then...I mean, I should work out. I have every intention to. But every day it&amp;rsquo;s like, &amp;ldquo;I&amp;rsquo;ll do it tomorrow, I&amp;rsquo;ll do it tomorrow.&amp;rdquo; And then tomorrow never comes. It&amp;rsquo;s the Samuel Beckett version of working out.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;10:00 a.m.&lt;/strong&gt; I need to know what&amp;rsquo;s happening in the world before I can do anything. I get The New York Times, the New York Post, and The Times of India delivered to the house, and I also read BBC&amp;rsquo;s website.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11:00 a.m.&lt;/strong&gt; I like to get work done on my phone, but I hate e-mails. Why do people respond with &amp;ldquo;Ok&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;Take care,&amp;rdquo; and not tell you anything useful? I can&amp;rsquo;t handle it. I have almost three million unread e-mails on my phone. It&amp;rsquo;s a party trick; I&amp;rsquo;ll show people my home screen. You can&amp;rsquo;t even see all the numbers on the little mail icon&amp;mdash;there are too many! If people need to reach me, they know to text or call. I also check&amp;nbsp;Instagram, but not my own account or messages. It&amp;rsquo;s more to see what&amp;rsquo;s happening. I had a Google alert on my name when it first started, but it got to be way too much. Now it&amp;rsquo;s only if I have a movie coming out or I need to know what&amp;rsquo;s the chatter. But I don&amp;rsquo;t Google myself, and I don&amp;rsquo;t Google Nick. There&amp;rsquo;s so muchinformation about us&amp;mdash;it&amp;rsquo;s overwhelming.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='image--0001_112420085117.png' src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/embed/202011/image--0001_112420085117.png' title='image--0001_112420085117.png' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;1:00 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt; Because I travel so much when I&amp;rsquo;m home I like to work out of my house. That means meetings with my team are usually at my place. My team is rather large, and mostly women, and there are many conflicting opinions, which I encourage! So there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of discussion about future projects, and there&amp;rsquo;s a lot of food&amp;mdash;always. I&amp;rsquo;ll have a charcuterie board. I&amp;rsquo;ll have sandwiches made, but I only eat them if they have Indian pickles on them. This is not a cucumber pickle; it&amp;rsquo;s like a pickled chili or a pickled mango. When relatives come to visit, they bring me some&amp;mdash;homemade! I like them in a cheese sandwich because to me it&amp;rsquo;s a mash-up of my worlds, you know?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;3:00 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt; I&amp;rsquo;m meant to be writing a book. It&amp;rsquo;s called Unfinished, but it&amp;rsquo;s also literally unfinished because my life&amp;rsquo;s been so crazy. It takes a lot of introspection on my part because it&amp;rsquo;s a memoir of my last 20 years in entertainment, so I like to sit on my couch or lie down on my bed with a journal or a piece of paper. I need a pen and paper to think.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;5:00 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt; I try to walk Diana around the neighborhood, but sometimes she just wants to be carried.Don&amp;rsquo;t we all?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;7:00 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt; Nick and I are not cookers, but we love to eat. Fortunately, a lot of people in my family love to cook, or one of our friends wants to cook, or we&amp;rsquo;ll bring in a chef. There&amp;rsquo;s a playlist I found online called &amp;lsquo;Cooking Italian dinner&amp;rsquo; (I&amp;rsquo;m serious!), and we like to blast it when we&amp;rsquo;re having pasta.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;9:00 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt; Our house is for our family and friends. We love having them over, and we just want them to be comfortable. I&amp;rsquo;m usually barefoot&amp;mdash;I love the way my feet feel on the cool marble floors&amp;mdash;and we get movie screeners sent to us, so we host a lot of movie nights. I hate watching movies I&amp;rsquo;m in; all I see are the faults. But I&amp;rsquo;m happy to watch Nick&amp;rsquo;s. I&amp;rsquo;ve never seen Camp Rock, and everyone makes fun of me about that, so maybe soon we&amp;rsquo;ll have a Camp Rock viewing party. I bet it will be great.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;11:00 p.m.&lt;/strong&gt; We play a lot of music before bed. Nick and I didn&amp;rsquo;t really know that much about each other&amp;rsquo;s careers before we came into each other&amp;rsquo;s lives. So we used to do a show-and-tell at night where it would be like, &amp;ldquo;This is my first song!&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;This is my first movie!&amp;rdquo; or &amp;ldquo;This is the first song I wrote myself!&amp;rdquo;, things like that. And, actually, that&amp;rsquo;s how we&amp;rsquo;re still getting to know each other.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;12:00 a.m.&lt;/strong&gt; I have to go to sleep in complete darkness, with no noise; otherwise, I&amp;rsquo;ll stay up all-night. I&amp;rsquo;ll binge-watch Queer Eye. I&amp;rsquo;ll call my mom or a friend or Nick, if one of us is travelling. But if we&amp;rsquo;re home, I love to sleep. n&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;As told to Faran Krentcil&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;PRIYANKA&amp;#39;S ESSENTIALS&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='image--004_112420084610.png' src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/embed/202011/image--004_112420084610.png' title='image--004_112420084610.png' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Nespresso espresso glass and saucer, Rs.1,400 (approx).&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='image--012_112420084639.png' src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/embed/202011/image--012_112420084639.png' title='image--012_112420084639.png' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;JBL speaker, Rs.12,999&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='image--006_112420084656.png' src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/embed/202011/image--006_112420084656.png' title='image--006_112420084656.png' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;Indian pickles&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='image--010_112420084847.png' src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/embed/202011/image--010_112420084847.png' title='image--010_112420084847.png' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Marc Jacobs Beauty Velvet Noir Major Volume Mascara, Rs. 2,000 (approx)&lt;/p&gt;",
