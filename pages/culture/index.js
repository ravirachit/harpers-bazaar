              "introtext": "A new exhibition at the Musée des Arts Décoratifs in Paris explores the history of fashion through the lens of Harper’s Bazaar",
              "fulltext": "&lt;p&gt;By Stephen Mooallem&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;On February&amp;nbsp;28, the Mus&amp;eacute;e des Arts D&amp;eacute;coratifs in Paris will mark the reopening of its newly renovated fashion galleries with an exhibition devoted to Harper&amp;rsquo;s Bazaar. First in Fashion will examine the history of fashion as it has unfolded in the pages of the magazine, spotlighting a collection of watershed moments and seismic shifts in the way we dress, think, and live as they were captured in&amp;mdash;and, in some cases, instigated by&amp;mdash;Bazaar. Overseen by MAD director Olivier Gabet and curators &amp;Eacute;ric Pujalet-Pl&amp;agrave;a and Marianne Le Galliard, with Bazaar&amp;rsquo;s former editor in chief, Glenda Bailey, and design director, Elizabeth Hummer, the exhibition charts Bazaar&amp;rsquo;s evolution from a 19th-century literary lifestyle journal that billed itself as &amp;ldquo;a repository for fashion, pleasure, and instruction&amp;rdquo; into the first modern fashion magazine.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure class='image'&gt;&lt;img alt=''  src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/image-003081220074943.png' width='343' /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption&gt;November 1992 by Peter Lindbergh&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The name of the exhibition is fitting: Since its founding in 1867, Bazaar has been present for an epoch of &amp;lsquo;firsts&amp;rsquo; in fashion, as well as myriad creative, cultural, and social revolutions. Bazaar&amp;mdash;or Bazar, as it was originally spelt&amp;mdash;was the first American magazine to dedicate itself to exploring the lives of women through fashion. Bazaar&amp;rsquo;s first editor, Mary Louise Booth, was involved in the women&amp;rsquo;s suffrage movement, and it was one of the first mainstream publications to advocate for voting rights, equal pay, and educational and professional opportunities for women. Bazaar was the first magazine to look at fashion within the context of art and culture, and the first to depict women in fashion in real environments, moving through real spaces in real-time. It was the first magazine to commission Richard Avedon, and the first to anoint denim and bikinis as fashion (the latter of which Diana Vreeland deemed &amp;ldquo;the most important thing since the atom bomb&amp;rdquo;). Bazaar was also the first to celebrate Dior&amp;rsquo;s New Look, the first to put a man on its cover, and the first to introduce Kate Moss to America.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure class='image'&gt;&lt;img alt=''  src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/image-000081220075049.png' width='357' /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption&gt;October 1968 by Hiro&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The list of creative talent who launched their careers in Bazaar and contributed to the magazine is equally impressive. Editors like Bailey, Booth, Carmel Snow, Nancy White, Anthony T Mazzola, and Liz Tilberis all shepherded Bazaar during long, transformative periods. Creative and art directors like Alexey Brodovitch, Henry Wolf, Marvin Israel, Ruth Ansel, Bea Feitler, Fabien Baron, and Stephen Gan broke new ground and helped change the visual vocabulary of magazines. Artists like Ert&amp;eacute;, Christian &amp;ldquo;B&amp;eacute;b&amp;eacute;&amp;rdquo; B&amp;eacute;rard, Marcel Vert&amp;egrave;s, AM Cassandre, Man Ray, Jean Cocteau, Salvador Dal&amp;iacute;, and Andy Warhol all did&amp;nbsp;illustrations for Bazaar. Writers and editors like Vreeland, Daisy Fellowes, Gloria Guinness, Eugenia Sheppard, Carrie Donovan, Tonne Goodman, Paul Cavaco, Sarah Mower, Melanie Ward, and Carine Roitfeld brought in new perspectives on fashion. Photographers like Avedon, Martin Munk&amp;aacute;csi, Toni Frissell, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Louise Dahl-Wolfe, Lillian Bassman, Melvin Sokolsky, Hiro, Francesco Scavullo, Patrick Demarchelier, Peter Lindbergh,&lt;br /&gt;\r\nJean-Paul Goude, and Karl Lagerfeld, who shot for Bazaar, expanded the potential of fashion imagery.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;figure class='image'&gt;&lt;img alt=''  src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/image-005081220075325.png' width='365' /&gt;\r\n&lt;figcaption&gt;October 1963 by Hiro&lt;/figcaption&gt;\r\n&lt;/figure&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The MAD show is firmly grounded in fashion, drawing upon the museum&amp;rsquo;s robust archive of more than 150,000 pieces. But the thread of Bazaar&amp;rsquo;s ongoing dialogue with fashion animates much of the material. The way Bazaar has covered fashion was undeniably shaped by the moment at which it was born. Patterned after a German publication called Der Bazar, Bazaar was originally conceived as a general interest weekly aimed at the women of the rising American leisure class that would cover fashion and the aristocratic social swirl in places like London, Paris, and Vienna, and offer advice on topics such as homemaking and etiquette alongside fiction and poetry. Under Mary Louise Booth&amp;rsquo;s leadership, Bazaar delivered glitzy coverage of the codes, clothes, manners, and modes of old-world high society, with a smattering of New York for good measure.

              "amp_fulltext": "&lt;p&gt;By Stephen Mooallem&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;On February&amp;nbsp;28, the Mus&eacute;e des Arts D&eacute;coratifs in Paris will mark the reopening of its newly renovated fashion galleries with an exhibition devoted to Harper&rsquo;s Bazaar. First in Fashion will examine the history of fashion as it has unfolded in the pages of the magazine, spotlighting a collection of watershed moments and seismic shifts in the way we dress, think, and live as they were captured in&mdash;and, in some cases, instigated by&mdash;Bazaar. Overseen by MAD director Olivier Gabet and curators &Eacute;ric Pujalet-Pl&agrave;a and Marianne Le Galliard, with Bazaar&rsquo;s former editor in chief, Glenda Bailey, and design director, Elizabeth Hummer, the exhibition charts Bazaar&rsquo;s evolution from a 19th-century literary lifestyle journal that billed itself as &ldquo;a repository for fashion, pleasure, and instruction&rdquo; into the first modern fashion magazine.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/image-003081220074943.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;425&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; heights=&quot;(min-width:500px) 200px, 80%&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;November 1992 by Peter Lindbergh&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The name of the exhibition is fitting: Since its founding in 1867, Bazaar has been present for an epoch of &lsquo;firsts&rsquo; in fashion, as well as myriad creative, cultural, and social revolutions. Bazaar&mdash;or Bazar, as it was originally spelt&mdash;was the first American magazine to dedicate itself to exploring the lives of women through fashion. Bazaar&rsquo;s first editor, Mary Louise Booth, was involved in the women&rsquo;s suffrage movement, and it was one of the first mainstream publications to advocate for voting rights, equal pay, and educational and professional opportunities for women. Bazaar was the first magazine to look at fashion within the context of art and culture, and the first to depict women in fashion in real environments, moving through real spaces in real-time. It was the first magazine to commission Richard Avedon, and the first to anoint denim and bikinis as fashion (the latter of which Diana Vreeland deemed &ldquo;the most important thing since the atom bomb&rdquo;). Bazaar was also the first to celebrate Dior&rsquo;s New Look, the first to put a man on its cover, and the first to introduce Kate Moss to America.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/image-000081220075049.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;425&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; heights=&quot;(min-width:500px) 200px, 80%&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;October 1968 by Hiro&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The list of creative talent who launched their careers in Bazaar and contributed to the magazine is equally impressive. Editors like Bailey, Booth, Carmel Snow, Nancy White, Anthony T Mazzola, and Liz Tilberis all shepherded Bazaar during long, transformative periods. Creative and art directors like Alexey Brodovitch, Henry Wolf, Marvin Israel, Ruth Ansel, Bea Feitler, Fabien Baron, and Stephen Gan broke new ground and helped change the visual vocabulary of magazines. Artists like Ert&eacute;, Christian &ldquo;B&eacute;b&eacute;&rdquo; B&eacute;rard, Marcel Vert&egrave;s, AM Cassandre, Man Ray, Jean Cocteau, Salvador Dal&iacute;, and Andy Warhol all did&amp;nbsp;illustrations for Bazaar. Writers and editors like Vreeland, Daisy Fellowes, Gloria Guinness, Eugenia Sheppard, Carrie Donovan, Tonne Goodman, Paul Cavaco, Sarah Mower, Melanie Ward, and Carine Roitfeld brought in new perspectives on fashion. Photographers like Avedon, Martin Munk&aacute;csi, Toni Frissell, Henri Cartier-Bresson, Louise Dahl-Wolfe, Lillian Bassman, Melvin Sokolsky, Hiro, Francesco Scavullo, Patrick Demarchelier, Peter Lindbergh,&lt;br&gt;\nJean-Paul Goude, and Karl Lagerfeld, who shot for Bazaar, expanded the potential of fashion imagery.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;figure class=&quot;image&quot;&gt;&lt;amp-img src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/image-005081220075325.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;425&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; heights=&quot;(min-width:500px) 200px, 80%&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;\n&lt;figcaption&gt;October 1963 by Hiro&lt;/figcaption&gt;\n&lt;/figure&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The MAD show is firmly grounded in fashion, drawing upon the museum&rsquo;s robust archive of more than 150,000 pieces.

              "introtext": "With her long-awaited novel 'The Mirror &amp; the Light', Hilary Mantel reveals the final chapter of her phenomenal trilogy, reimagining the scandal and decadence of the Tudors. In an India exclusive, she talks to Bazaar about her controversial protagonist, the power of women in the court, and the boundaries of historical fiction",
              "fulltext": "&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The trilogy charts the rise and fall of Thomas Cromwell, a powerful advisor to King Henry VIII. What made you focus on him, and what did you hope to convey in a larger sense through his story?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The larger purpose is always to tell a story that bridges understanding between different ages and different cultures. Thomas Cromwell&amp;rsquo;s biography is one that anyone can understand: A man from an obscure background uses his resources to achieve power and wealth. It&amp;rsquo;s easy to grasp, on an intellectual and emotional level. But what holds readers is the specific: This time, this place, this character, this particular set of circumstances. All the time as an author you are trying to move between the two: The universal, and the very local and particular. You are looking for a character and a narrative curve that will allow you to make that move. Thomas Cromwell seemed to be a richly ambiguous character. Is he just the sum of his actions? Is it possible to understand what drove him? And given that he was a central figure in one of the most charged and fraught decades of English history, why was he so absent from the page, in novels, drama, biography?&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&amp;rsquo;ve spent over a decade with Thomas Cromwell&amp;mdash;are you ready to let go of the character?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;No question of letting go&amp;mdash;I am now absorbed in creating the stage version.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did the theatre adaptations of the previous two books influence your experience of writing the third?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Working on the theatre versions made me brisker. That may seem to be an odd word to apply to a big book. But what matters is not the word count, but the pace and power within each scene.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The earlier books in the trilogy&amp;mdash;Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies&amp;mdash;both won the Man Booker Prize. Did that add pressure to The Mirror &amp;amp; the Light?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;As I publish, yes, I feel the pressure&amp;mdash;but when I was writing, I had no thought but the scene in my head.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As an author, what appeals to you most about historical fiction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;I think you write what you want to read. As a young reader, I loved history and literature equally, so I was always looking for good historical fiction. I also wanted ghost stories&amp;mdash;maybe the two forms are not so different. Very early, I noticed that certain themes and personalities were missing from the fictional picture. Both in the manner and in content, historical fiction seemed to be conservative. I wanted to challenge that.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt=''  src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/130-131-hot-list-crowning-glory-1111220051626.jpeg' width='343' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you hope to add to the story by fictionalising certain elements? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Fiction is not icing on the cake; it is the cake. Whatever era you look at, the record is incomplete and subject to different interpretations; the story is owned by whoever is telling it. The project of historical fiction is a radical reimagining. You throw out what you think you know, then look at the record afresh. Then you try to work out what is missing, and why, and ask yourself what could have existed in the blank spaces.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you maintain the balance between dramatisation and the truth, and authenticity in writing about real events?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;I work with the facts as far as they go, and try to get the best facts I can. Within the limits of my scholarship, I do have rules. I don&amp;rsquo;t put people where they couldn&amp;rsquo;t be. I don&amp;rsquo;t put speeches in their mouths unless there are no recorded words to draw on. I make sure they operate within a world view and frame of reference that they could have held. But there are many kinds of historical fiction. I would apply these rules across the board, even to my own work. For instance, my novel The Giant O&amp;rsquo;Brien is closer to myth than sober fact, and works differently. It&amp;rsquo;s closer to a song or a poem.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does your research and self-education entail? Does it happen alongside the writing process or do you view them as two separate parts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The groundwork is becoming familiar with a culture through art, music, religion, science. But research and writing can&amp;rsquo;t be separate, because until I write a specific section, I don&amp;rsquo;t know what I need to know. Curiosity grows through the life of a project.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you approach writing about women during a time when they had very little agency and control? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;One of the attractions of writing about the court of Henry VIII is that women have vital power and agency. Only a woman can give Henry the heir he craves. But which woman? It&amp;rsquo;s the question that dominates his reign&lt;/p&gt;",

Thomas Cromwell&rsquo;s biography is one that anyone can understand: A man from an obscure background uses his resources to achieve power and wealth. It&rsquo;s easy to grasp, on an intellectual and emotional level. But what holds readers is the specific: This time, this place, this character, this particular set of circumstances. All the time as an author you are trying to move between the two: The universal, and the very local and particular. You are looking for a character and a narrative curve that will allow you to make that move. Thomas Cromwell seemed to be a richly ambiguous character. Is he just the sum of his actions? Is it possible to understand what drove him? And given that he was a central figure in one of the most charged and fraught decades of English history, why was he so absent from the page, in novels, drama, biography?&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;You&rsquo;ve spent over a decade with Thomas Cromwell&mdash;are you ready to let go of the character?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;No question of letting go&mdash;I am now absorbed in creating the stage version.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How did the theatre adaptations of the previous two books influence your experience of writing the third?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Working on the theatre versions made me brisker. That may seem to be an odd word to apply to a big book. But what matters is not the word count, but the pace and power within each scene.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;The earlier books in the trilogy&mdash;Wolf Hall and Bring Up The Bodies&mdash;both won the Man Booker Prize. Did that add pressure to The Mirror &amp;amp; the Light?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;As I publish, yes, I feel the pressure&mdash;but when I was writing, I had no thought but the scene in my head.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;As an author, what appeals to you most about historical fiction?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I think you write what you want to read. As a young reader, I loved history and literature equally, so I was always looking for good historical fiction. I also wanted ghost stories&mdash;maybe the two forms are not so different. Very early, I noticed that certain themes and personalities were missing from the fictional picture. Both in the manner and in content, historical fiction seemed to be conservative. I wanted to challenge that.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;amp-img alt src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/130-131-hot-list-crowning-glory-1111220051626.jpeg&quot; width=&quot;1116&quot; height=&quot;1706&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What do you hope to add to the story by fictionalising certain elements? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Fiction is not icing on the cake; it is the cake. Whatever era you look at, the record is incomplete and subject to different interpretations; the story is owned by whoever is telling it. The project of historical fiction is a radical reimagining. You throw out what you think you know, then look at the record afresh. Then you try to work out what is missing, and why, and ask yourself what could have existed in the blank spaces.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you maintain the balance between dramatisation and the truth, and authenticity in writing about real events?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;I work with the facts as far as they go, and try to get the best facts I can. Within the limits of my scholarship, I do have rules. I don&rsquo;t put people where they couldn&rsquo;t be. I don&rsquo;t put speeches in their mouths unless there are no recorded words to draw on. I make sure they operate within a world view and frame of reference that they could have held. But there are many kinds of historical fiction. I would apply these rules across the board, even to my own work. For instance, my novel The Giant O&rsquo;Brien is closer to myth than sober fact, and works differently. It&rsquo;s closer to a song or a poem.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;What does your research and self-education entail? Does it happen alongside the writing process or do you view them as two separate parts?&lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The groundwork is becoming familiar with a culture through art, music, religion, science. But research and writing can&rsquo;t be separate, because until I write a specific section, I don&rsquo;t know what I need to know. Curiosity grows through the life of a project.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;strong&gt;How do you approach writing about women during a time when they had very little agency and control? &lt;/strong&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;One of the attractions of writing about the court of Henry VIII is that women have vital power and agency. Only a woman can give Henry the heir he craves. But which woman? It&rsquo;s the question that dominates his reign&lt;/p&gt;",

              "fulltext": "&lt;p style='text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px'&gt;&lt;span style='font-size:11pt'&gt;&lt;span style='font-family:Calibri,sans-serif'&gt;Amnesty’s epigraph borrows from an inscription on an arch in Chinatown, Sydney. It reads:&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/span&gt; “Within the four seas all men are brothers”. Irony eclipses idealism—in today’s world, this is a widely incongruous thought. The year 2020 began with Brexit finally becoming a reality, intensifying the fraught position of the non-white immigrant in the West. And as Britain’s immigration laws remain in a state of flux, its lawmakers see a blueprint in the hardline anti-immigrant regulations of Australia, a country that is currently interning thousands of migrants. Under such political affairs then, Aravind Adiga’s fourth novel is well-timed.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p style='text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px'&gt;&lt;br /&gt;\r\n“What it means to be brown, in a white country, is a central theme of the novel,” he says. “Besides South Africa, nowhere else was race—whiteness—as integral to the construction of national identity in Britain’s colonies as in Australia. Even though it is now very multicultural, it is impossible to write a novel set in Sydney without factoring in the ever-present legacy of race.” This burden of race, of being different, is a reality that our protagonist is all too conscious of. Dhananjaya Rajaratnam is a Sri Lankan Tamil, and a man of many sobriquets: Danny, Honest Danny, Incredible Cleaner Danny. His hair is streaked golden, his accent ‘nearly’ Australian, and his everyday bearing guided by a set of proscriptions—‘Never walk and eat in daylight. They see you’. In four years of working as a cleaner, living in the stockroom of a grocery store, Danny has ingested this hard pill—at all times, the brown immigrant must be invisible. This is also why the author decided early on that all his protagonists would be South Asian.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p style='text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px'&gt;Amnesty takes place within the scope of one day, as the events are set into motion with the murder of Danny’s client, the Indian-Australian Radha Thomas. Being the only one to know of the killer—her lover, Dr Prakash—Danny is faced with a conundrum that becomes the narratorial pivot: Should he report Prakash at the cost of being deported? In Prakash, Danny is threatened by someone from his own race, only differing in the legality&lt;br /&gt;\r\nof their being. Even as Adiga explores race and migration through the wider binary of ‘white’ and ‘coloured’, he draws attention to divergent categories of immigrants along margins of class and generations: “Australia has developed a permanent two-tiered multicultural society:&lt;br /&gt;\r\nIn the top slab, you have many successful South Asians who have often married white&lt;br /&gt;\r\nAustralians. These are also the only people white Australians notice when they talk of&lt;br /&gt;\r\nthemselves as a ‘race-blind’ society. But there is a growing second tier in this multi-racial&lt;br /&gt;\r\nsociety—an enormous and permanent brown underclass.”&lt;br /&gt;\r\nAravind Adiga’s family emigrated to Sydney during his teenage years. After completing&lt;br /&gt;\r\nschool there, he went on to graduate from Columbia University, New York—a migration trajectory quite different from that of Danny’s. “In India, would I be bothered by the exploitation of international students? I don’t know. But in Australia, I am always a minority, always a brown man, and always observing—and being pricked by—things I see happening to South Asians around me... Every brown man in Sydney, rich or poor, has to beg one day or the other, Danny realises. That line is at the heart of Amnesty. The novel is also an exploration of masculinity—what it is to be a brown man in a part of the world where the prevailing culture tries to emasculate you, regardless of your economic status.”&lt;br /&gt;\r\nIn Adiga’s writing, fiction runs concurrent to fact. And as is the nature of reality, answers are never self-evident. Danny’s experience exists within a nexus of several migrant stories—Malaysian classmates who pick fruit, the Japanese-American ‘Abe the abseiler’—and until the very end, uncertainty haunts the narrative. “Amnesty is not a novel about reconciliation between the South Asian protagonist and the Western society he has arrived in. Both in the West and in India, there is an insatiable appetite for successful immigrant stories: ‘Boy from Patiala becomes richest man in New Jersey!’” He adds, “I’ve got my eye on other kinds of stories.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p style='text-align:justify; margin-bottom:8px'&gt;&lt;img alt='' src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/202012/img66091220123415.jpeg' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;",

              "fulltext": "&lt;p&gt;&amp;quot;In the run-up to my wedding day, I did what every aspiring bride I knew laboured over&amp;mdash; get in shape.&amp;quot;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;By Shruti Rya Ganguly&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;'&gt;I looked up a variety of diets&amp;mdash;Whole 30, Atkin&amp;rsquo;s, Keto, intermittent fasting. And then I researched some of the most effective workouts in New York City. Strengthen-Lengthen-Tone, or SLT, came up as one of the hardest but most transformative. I mean, Scarlett Johansson and Meghan Markle swore by it. Well, the first thing you need to know is that there&amp;rsquo;s something called a megaformer, which is like the Ultron of the reformer. An SLT class uses said machine and in a 50-minute span you find yourself doing cardio, strength training, and toning. But I need to take a step back and explain something here. As a young person, I was incredibly athletic, playing everything from soccer, basketball, tennis, badminton to table tennis. When I went to Northwestern University, I wanted to try a new sport&amp;mdash;rowing. After two tough semesters of crew, I spent the next three years of my degree focusing on all the social and political extracurriculars I could, and my various advanced double major-and-a-minor classes. I wasn&amp;rsquo;t a varsity athlete anymore and I certainly wasn&amp;rsquo;t going pro. Late-night Papa John&amp;rsquo;s pizza and breadsticks with garlic sauce eventually became my studying vice. My grades were pretty good, the partying was remarkably active, and my skin, terrible. By senior year, I had developed an eating disorder&amp;mdash;bulimia. My close friends and family had a series of interventions.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;'&gt;While I had lost an incredible amount of weight, my acne-free skin (from medications) was sallow and had lost its glow. I had to relearn eating habits, and this became an important mental and personal challenge that took me months to fight through. I did it, with support. After moving to NYC, I dabbled in yoga every now and then and started to play some club sports. When a friend said that his India-based non-profit Magic Bus was organising a NYC Marathon team and that there were spots, I jumped at the opportunity. I then panicked when I actually got placed. I hadn&amp;rsquo;t run long distance in 14 years, and I was by no means a runner. I was going to do this for charity, and I didn&amp;rsquo;t mean myself. In the midst of a full-time job at MTV while producing various feature films, I began training. But in the month leading up to the marathon, things got crazy with work. We had gotten into the Venice Film Festival&amp;rsquo;s Biennale College programme, I got an INK Fellowship, and one of my films was green-lit for production in California. &lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;span style='font-family: verdana, geneva, sans-serif;'&gt;Marathon day came, rainy and cold. Three miles in, I felt my right knee pinch, a few more miles and soon my left was giving out. Halfway through I couldn&amp;rsquo;t run anymore. I limped my way through Queens and the Bronx. At the top of Central Park, the final stretch, I thought to myself, I didn&amp;rsquo;t come here to walk. And so I ran, for the last two miles. I collapsed on the other side of the finish line, and was wheelchaired off to another medical tent with more ice, pain killers, and encouragement. Then, last year, an ongoing ache in my knees, and a recent skiing injury where I hurt my lower back, affected my occasional workout. I had a timeline and extra motivation. My wedding! Granted, we were going to do a small ceremony in the Oslo Town Hall with just our immediate families, but still, I needed an excuse to fit into my Bibhu Mohapatra dress. When I got on that megaformer at SLT, I discovered muscles that I didn&amp;rsquo;t think I had and none of it was easy. After reluctantly going for three classes during the same week, something shifted. There suddenly was a mental switch that had been hidden in a deep recess. Strength. I was becoming strong. Stronger. There was a change in how I viewed what I was trying to do. While losing weight had been a goal, I now just wanted to feel powerful in my own body. To take control of it, and to know it. I started to combine SLT with yoga and Physique 57. I took a break from carbs and sugar for a few months. My skin, the largest organ in the body, became supple and golden. What I realised a few weeks leading up to our big day was that my wedding wasn&amp;rsquo;t going to be the full stop in my commitment to myself. Since then, I&amp;rsquo;ve continued that dedication to my health and wellness&amp;mdash;a mix of yoga, Pilates, whatever seems interesting to me in Oslo, and of course SLT when I&amp;rsquo;m Stateside. I&amp;rsquo;m now of the mindset that it&amp;rsquo;s important to have milestones, not as abrupt stops but as continuations of a revolving foundation. I&amp;rsquo;ve learned to be comfortable with my discomfort&amp;mdash;it only implies that I&amp;rsquo;m growing&amp;mdash; either stronger physically or as a person. And there&amp;rsquo;s always room for growth. Not just for a wedding, but oneself.&lt;/span&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;",
