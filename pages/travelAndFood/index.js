Roque<br />\nSevilla, the former mayor of Quito, has saved from the widespread<br />\ndeforestation 3,000 precious acres of forest, home to 800 endemic<br />\nspecies of animal and plant life, more than 400 varieties of birds,<br />\nand 300 types of butterflies and moths. The lodge and the land<br />\nprovide a livelihood to members of the once struggling local<br />\ncommunity, who serve as charming and expert guides alongside<br />\na team of world-class botanists. Moving to the rhythm of the</p>\n\n<p>day, we joined the emerald winged hummingbird and the rose-<br />\nfaced parrots that woke with the dawn; we swung from the vines;</p>\n\n<p>we walked, rubber-booted, along the pebble floor of the Laguna<br />\nRiver, and rode high above the thick vegetation of the canopy<br />\non a sky-bicycle made for two. We marvelled at an owl moth<br />\nthe size of a fist by torchlight; and listened to the pulsating,<br />\ntransparent frog, his deep-throated croak filling the night air.<br />\nI asked our guide, Jos&eacute;, to give me his view of Mashpi, the place<br />\nwhere clouds are born. &ldquo;M&aacute;gico,&rdquo; he replied without hesitation.</p>\n\n<p>Mashpilodge.com</p>\n\n<p>By Juliet Nicolson</p>"

I’ve travelled to this city four times and still haven’t had my fill of its exceptional museums. Amongst the most memorable I’ve visited is the Herzog &amp; de Meuron-designed, CaixaForum—it has many special architectural details. In particular, is a stairway that’s straight of out 2001: A Space Odyssey, and a monumental vertical garden, that could easily blend into a set piece on Avatar. The Palacio de Cristal is another stunning structure: the palace features a breathtaking cupola, and being built almost entirely with glass, looks beautiful from the outside. El Retiro Park is another a visual delight, peppered in equal measure with galleries, sculptures, and flora of all kinds. The view from the roof of the Círculo de Bellas Artes is quite simply spectacular. I usually head there for a drink to catch the sunset and an unrestricted, bird’s-eye view of the entire city. I also make sure I attend a flamenco performance whenever I’m in the country, and the Teatro Flamenco—listed as the world’s first flamenco theatre—is one of the best for this. I would also recommend visiting the Mercado de San Miguel, where you have about 20 restaurants under a very beautiful roof, offering you a wide gamut of flavours.”&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='image--0031_112320023332.png'  src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/embed/202011/image--0031_112320023332.png' title='image--0031_112320023332.png' width='366' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Arvind Vijaymohan, CEO, Artery India&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='image--0051_112320023516.png'  src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/embed/202011/image--0051_112320023516.png' title='image--0051_112320023516.png' width='391' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;The Círculo de Bellas Artes.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Do Try: “I’ve always been a raging shoe collector, and Spain has some of the finest craftsmen of this trade.

I have been there many times since. In fact, even while travelling to other Southeast Asian countries, I try to take a flight with a layover in Singapore. My sister also lives there, so it&amp;rsquo;s nice to have a family in a city that you love so much. What&amp;rsquo;s amazing about it is that it offers something for everyone, whether you enjoy shopping, are a foodie, or like sightseeing. The city offers both world cuisine and Michelin-starred street food...and what&amp;rsquo;s not to love about that? Lau Pa Sat is a haven for street food and is a great blend of striking architecture local delicacies. I would also recommend trying out Bacha Coffee, a gorgeous Moroccan-themed coffee boutique. Some of Singapore&amp;rsquo;s star attractions include East Coast Park and Beach&amp;mdash;I love going there for a walk. Clarke Quay and 1-Altitude bar are two of my favourite places to experience the thriving nightlife of the city. And finally, there&amp;rsquo;s Sentosa island, which may sound run-of-the-mill, but falls under the category of must-visit places.&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='image--0012_112320045333.png' src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/embed/202011/image--0012_112320045333.png' title='image--0012_112320045333.png' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maanvi Gagroo, Actor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Do Try:&amp;ldquo;Going for the TreeTop Walk was one of the best decisions I made. If you love the great outdoors, this lush trail will make you very, very happy. It isn&amp;rsquo;t the most-adventurous thing one can do, but it sure leaves you exhilarated.&amp;rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;img alt='image--0052_112320045602.png' src='https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/embed/202011/image--0052_112320045602.png' title='image--0052_112320045602.png' /&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;Kilic Ali Pasa Hamam&lt;/p&gt;\r\n\r\n&lt;p&gt;My Tip:&amp;nbsp;Instead of shopping for brands one can find the world over, I love exploring local boutiques to understand whatthe city has to offer. My favourite is Bugis Street because it offers the best of street shopping.

I have been there many times since. In fact, even while travelling to other Southeast Asian countries, I try to take a flight with a layover in Singapore. My sister also lives there, so it&rsquo;s nice to have a family in a city that you love so much. What&rsquo;s amazing about it is that it offers something for everyone, whether you enjoy shopping, are a foodie, or like sightseeing. The city offers both world cuisine and Michelin-starred street food...and what&rsquo;s not to love about that? Lau Pa Sat is a haven for street food and is a great blend of striking architecture local delicacies. I would also recommend trying out Bacha Coffee, a gorgeous Moroccan-themed coffee boutique. Some of Singapore&rsquo;s star attractions include East Coast Park and Beach&mdash;I love going there for a walk. Clarke Quay and 1-Altitude bar are two of my favourite places to experience the thriving nightlife of the city. And finally, there&rsquo;s Sentosa island, which may sound run-of-the-mill, but falls under the category of must-visit places.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;amp-img src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/embed/202011/image--0012_112320045333.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;425&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; heights=&quot;(min-width:500px) 200px, 80%&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;em&gt;Maanvi Gagroo, Actor&lt;/em&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Do Try:&ldquo;Going for the TreeTop Walk was one of the best decisions I made. If you love the great outdoors, this lush trail will make you very, very happy. It isn&rsquo;t the most-adventurous thing one can do, but it sure leaves you exhilarated.&rdquo;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&amp;nbsp;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;amp-img src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/embed/202011/image--0052_112320045602.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;425&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; heights=&quot;(min-width:500px) 200px, 80%&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Kilic Ali Pasa Hamam&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;My Tip:&amp;nbsp;Instead of shopping for brands one can find the world over, I love exploring local boutiques to understand whatthe city has to offer. My favourite is Bugis Street because it offers the best of street shopping. For luxury brands, visitOrchard Street.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;amp-img src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/embed/202011/image--0032_112320045528.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;425&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; heights=&quot;(min-width:500px) 200px, 80%&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;The Bacha Coffee.&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;&lt;amp-img src=&quot;https://akm-img-a-in.tosshub.com/sites/gloss99/resources/embed/202011/image--0042_112320053012.png&quot; alt=&quot;&quot; height=&quot;425&quot; width=&quot;650&quot; layout=&quot;responsive&quot; heights=&quot;(min-width:500px) 200px, 80%&quot;&gt;&lt;/amp-img&gt;&lt;/p&gt;\n\n&lt;p&gt;Aerial view of TreeTopWalk in Singapore.&lt;/p&gt;",
